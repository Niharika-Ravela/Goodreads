# Goodreads
This is a end-to-end project that extracts my goodreads shelf using the rss list and then generates a random book from the list and displays it as a result in the UI wheel and along with the tile of the book the code also uses Google Books API and extract the cover for that book and displays it along with the wheel's result.
